🚀 Excited to share my latest project! 🚀

I've developed an interactive "Drum Kit" game designed to make learning the alphabet fun for kids! 🥁🎶

Each letter is associated with a different drum sound, turning the learning experience into a musical adventure. This project was inspired by the teachings of Dr. Angela Yu and was built using JavaScript DOM manipulation techniques.

Check it out and let me know what you think! Feedback and suggestions are always welcome.
